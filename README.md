## TypeScript To-Do List

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

I built a TypeScript to-do list based on this Web Dev Simplified [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBmrduvKl5w&t=67s). `npm start` runs the app in the development mode, and open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser. Enter a task by typing it in and clicking the `Add` button. Mark a task complete or incomplete by toggling the checkbox.
